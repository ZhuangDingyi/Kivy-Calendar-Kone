Kivy 1.1.1 Calendar with Python3

I'm new to kivy programming. Thanks to the effort of [kiok46](https://github.com/kiok46/Kivy-Calender), this project is based on its prototype to build a calendar-type maintenance GUI.

The project is the products of my bachelor thesis and contains desensitization data of KONE elevators. The aim of creating this calendar-based GUI is to make the maintenance visualable. We use Supported Vector Regression (SVR) as the method for failure prediction and Weibull AFT model and covriates as the risk factor for cost. The GUI can reflect the elevator distribution in city Shanghai and Kunshan.

Just run model.py to get the final output.

* .kv files are made for interface design, you can refer to [kivy documentation](
https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/first_app.html) for further details.
* model.py is the cost function and its optimization for predictive maintenance. It combines SVR and Weibull AFT model to design the cost.
* test_sample6.csv is the data used for 

Some logos and information contains Chinese but does not inflence the reading.
